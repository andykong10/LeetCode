**Note**: The list is not mutually exclusive. It stores the chronological information of when each question was done.

**Notation**:
- Basic: Well designed questions so important that you must know.
- Exotic: Exotic questions (not necessarily a bad question). Should be skipped during a fast go-over.
- Hard: Hard to understand questions. Should be skipped during a fast go-over. Don't spend too much time on it.
- Bad: Badly designed questions with lots of down voting. You shouldn't waste your time here unless you have plenty.
